# Go CRUD API with MongoDB
Explore the dynamic trio of Go, Gorilla Mux, and MongoDB to build a high-performance API. Go’s speed, Gorilla Mux’s simplicity, 
and MongoDB’s flexibility to create a scalable and efficient API. 

### CRUD
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations enable you to work with data stored in MongoDB with Go.
- **Read Operations** find and return documents stored in your database.
- **Write Operations** insert, modify, or delete documents in your database.
Some operations combine aspects of read and write operations. To learn more about these hybrid methods, see [Compound Operations](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/fundamentals/crud/compound-operations/#std-label-golang-compound-operations).
